A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. This COVID-19, normal, and other lung infection dataset is released in stages. In the first release, we have released 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal, and 1345 viral pneumonia chest X-ray (CXR) images. In the first update, we have increased the COVID-19 class to 1200 CXR images. In the 2nd update, we have increased the database to 3616 COVID-19 positive cases along with 10,192 Normal, 6012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection), and 1345 Viral Pneumonia images. We will continue to update this database as soon as we have new x-ray images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

Our New Dataset
**COVID-QU-Ex Dataset
**The researchers of Qatar University have compiled the COVID-QU-Ex dataset, which consists of 33,920 chest X-ray (CXR) images including:
11,956 COVID-19, 11,263 Non-COVID infections (Viral or Bacterial Pneumonia), and 10,701 Normal
Ground-truth lung segmentation masks are provided for the entire dataset. This is the largest ever created lung mask dataset.
Besides, 2,913 COVID-19 Infection Segmentation masks are provided from our previous QaTaCov project.
